# CanadianFarmsProject
The link for this project is too large to download, but this is where I got the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryan208/canadian-farm-production-dataset-19202024
The given description for this dataset is: 
This dataset provides a comprehensive synthetic simulation of Canadian farm production data from 1920 to 2024. It includes detailed insights on crop types, average yield, weather conditions, soil profiles, irrigation, pesticide use, organic practices, and economic factors like pricing and farm value. It also considers the adoption of agricultural technology over time and the impact of historical agricultural policies. The dataset is ideal for agricultural modeling, climate impact studies, time-series analysis, and machine learning applications in agritech.
